        <h2 id="tit2">Battleaid</h2>
        <p id="text2">Battleaid is a tool developed for First Robotics Competition teams to better manage, change, and keep track of constants in their code. Often in FRC programming, there are values that have to be tuned in order for the robot to perform optimally. While one could just make all of the variables in code, this makes it so you have to send the whole code file to the robot for a change that can amount to mere bytes. This wastes a lot of time, around a minute for each redownload, so in comes Battleaid. Instead of writing your constants directly in the code, the values are stored in a separate file that can be downloaded separately from the code in a matter of seconds. This leads to better organization and much faster tuning of constants. I contributed to this project by assisting in the design, testing and providing feedback, programming assistance, and documentation assistance.

        <h2 id="tit1">Soccer Duel</h2>
        <p id="text1">Soccer Duel is a game I created with a small team for a summer camp for Game Design at the University of Texas at Austin. It is a 2D multiplayer game in which you attempt to score a goal on the other player, similar to real soccer. The guiding principle of the design of this game is “Easy to learn, hard to master”. The controls are very simple, only being movement and a kick for the ball, however the complexity comes from the player’s positioning and momentum before coming in contact with the ball. Kicks from different angles or falling result in vastly different ball trajectories, all leading to the game being easy to learn mechanically, however challenging to fully master it. For this project, I was the lead programmer and assisted with the design. It was written in HTML and JavaScript using the Phaser library.

        <h2 id="tit2">Non-A-Gon</h2>
        <p id="text2">Non-A-Gon is a platformer game I created by myself over the summer in 2024. It focuses on a mix of physics puzzle solving and tricky platforming, integrating the two by giving the player a bouncy ball they can throw and teleport to. Since the ball is affected by physics, the player has to consider where it will bounce to and if it is safe to teleport there from that position. I wanted to challenge myself to create a game in only two weeks using no premade assets. Because of this, all art, music, programming, and level design is my creation.

        <h2 id="tit1">Theater shows</h2>
        <p id="text1">I assisted with the tech of various shows at the Nolan Catholic Theater Company, including The Man Who came to Dinner, Mary Poppins, Our Town, Fiddler on the Roof, The Old Man and The Old Moon, The Little Mermaid, Clue, and Oklahoma. For all of these shows, I worked on the lighting design, rigging, and cues. The shows are in chronological order, with each set of two indicating a year. Throughout the years, I gained both technical skills and leadership and eventually became the technical director of lights and sound by my senior year.
