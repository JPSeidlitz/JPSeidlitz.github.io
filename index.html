        <h2 id="tit1s">Hello, I'm John Paul</h2>
        <p id="text1">I am a first year Game Design & Development and Spanish major at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Before that, I was the programming lead for FRC team 4206 specializing in vision systems and position estimation as well as the Technical Director of lights and sound for the Nolan Catholic Theater Company. These leadership positions not only taught me technical and design skills, but also how to effectively communicate. I am always working on a new idea or project, however I would love to get back to working as a team to create something magical.

                <h3 id="roboticsHeader">Robotics</h3>
                <p>During my time as part of the RoboVikes, I learned not only how to program proficiently, but also how to communicate complex ideas clearly and concisely. I developed my skills as a programmer, not only learning how to perform actions, but also how to write code that other programmers can read and use easily. This skill was invaluable when I became the lead programmer for the team as I had to constantly share my code and work collaboratively with my crew. In the 2024 season my leadership was recognized as I was nominated by my team for the Dean’s List award, an award given to an individual student for leadership, and placed as a semi-finalist at the Fort Worth District Event. </p>

                <p>While robotics taught me complex ideas and clear communication, technical theater taught me visual design, organizational thinking, and professional communication. I drafted and workshopped lighting plots and reached out to professionals for both feedback and to rent them for our performances. Once the lights were in the theater, I led my crew in designing cues, color schemes, and effects for the show. During shows, I was the liaison between the director and the light and sound crew heads going through the cues. </p>
