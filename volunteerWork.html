        <h2 id="tit2">Summer Camps</h2>
        <p id="text2">In the summer of 2024, I assisted with teaching a programming and robotics summer camp at Nolan Catholic High School for middle schoolers. The camp focused on teaching students the fundamentals of design and programming by building Lego robots to wrestle each other in a ring. While I primarily assisted students with their individual code, I did teach a few lessons myself. In addition to this camp, in 2023 I assisted Saint Andrew’s middle school with their performance of ByeBye Birdie by teaching them how to work with lighting systems.

        <p id="text1">Almost every week for two years, I ran the sound system for my school’s weekly Catholic Mass.

A major issue I had to deal with was the tendency for the mics to pick up feedback due to the room Mass was being held being made mostly of concrete, thus echoing sound very well. Additionally, I ran the sound system for various school events such as assemblies, school wide presentations, and guest speakers.

        <p id="text2">While I was on the Robotics team, I also assisted with any team that needed assistance with their programming or electronic work. Specifically, teams 7535 - Purple Poison and Team 7534 - Dragonflies I helped year after year with programming assistance due to their teams having less resources and programmers than ours. Additionally, at events I helped any team that was having
